1. Want to get the game working properly
* New piece should "fall" into correct spot - should not be moving rows/columns
* Proper scoring during matching with bonus for multiple match within one turn

2. Make pieces and board look nicer
* It is all in 3D - why not use 3D properly!
* Slight camera wobble during movement / moving the pieces

3. Sound
* Be interesting learning process to get sounds into the game

4. Visual FX
* Need eye candy when/if the game play works
